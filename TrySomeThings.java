    Hello! This section doesn't contain anything that you are required to do, 
    so if you're trying to speedrun this assignment, you can just ignore this. Or even delete the file. It doesn't matter.

    Often when doing a project like this, I personally find myself having to tab out to a different window whenever I need to 
    test out a feature of Java without the clutter of my current code. So, I decided to make a space like that right here: an
    acessible clean slate for you to test anything out in isolation. If you're confused about how a certain function works, mess
    with it in here, and once you get it, you can return to whatever activity you were doing before. 

    So, yeah. This is completely optional, and is just here for convenience. Do whatever with this file, it doesn't matter.
